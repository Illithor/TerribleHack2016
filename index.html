	<h1>Something terrible here</h1>
  		<p>As two UWaterloo 1A students, Carey and Kiera are terrible enough to sign up for TerribleHack with little programming experience - this is the first hackathon for both of us.</p>
  		<p>We both have some skill in DrRacket <del>which seems useless</del> and html, so we searched on the internet and tried to make something fancy called "parallax scrolling".</p>
  		<p>However, our poor skills managed to make the people in the picture fly up to the sky. So to make flying possible and reasonbale, we added wings to their backs.</p>
  		<p>Carey did the PhotoShop works base on her professional PS skills while opening tons of tabs in the browser together with Kiera and learn jQuery and JavaScript from scratch.</p>
  		<p>We are proud of our webpage.</p>
  		<p>We think it's terrible though.</p>
